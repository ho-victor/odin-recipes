    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Risotto is like a high maintenance partner - 
        it requires constant attention 
        and care, 
        but in the end, it's totally worth it!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
    <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

</ol>


<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In a large saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer and 
        keep it warm over low heat.
    </li>
    <li>In a separate large, heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil 
        over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic
         and sauté until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir to coat with the 
        onion and garlic mixture. Toast the rice, stirring 
        constantly, for 1-2 minutes until it starts to turn 
        slightly golden in color.
    </li>
    <li>Add the white wine to the pot and stir until it is 
        absorbed by the rice.</li>
    <li>Begin adding the warm broth to the pot, about 1/2 cup at a 
        time, stirring constantly until each addition is 
        absorbed by the rice. Continue adding broth
         and stirring until the rice is tender and creamy, 
         but still slightly firm in the center. 
         This should take about 18-20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in the unsalted butter and grated Parmesan 
        cheese until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the pot from heat and let the risotto rest for a 
        few minutes before serving. The risotto should be creamy and loose, 
        but not too runny. If it seems too thick, you can add a little more 
        broth or water to loosen it up.
    </li>
    <li>Serve the risotto hot, garnished with additional grated Parmesan cheese and chopped 
        fresh herbs, if desired.
    </li>
</ol>
